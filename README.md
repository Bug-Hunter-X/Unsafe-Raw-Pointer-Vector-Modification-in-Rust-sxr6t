This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and vector manipulation. Modifying a vector through a raw pointer is dangerous because it bypasses Rust's memory safety mechanisms. The example shows how this can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption.  The solution demonstrates safe alternatives using vector indexing or other memory-safe methods.  Always prioritize safe methods over unsafe code in Rust.
